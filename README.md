## Volunteering

I participated with the NHS Pycom in the development of [nhspy-plothedots](https://github.com/nhs-pycom/nhspy-plotthedots), a package for [Statistical Process Control](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/qsir-statistical-process-control.pdf) analysis and plotting. My mean contribution was creating **unit test** scripts. This gave me an opportunity to (a) know more about the package so I can contribute in other areas in the future and (b) practice software development skills (e.g. unit testing,  raise pull request) that I have use in my professional career but they may not show up in my Data Science portfolio.
